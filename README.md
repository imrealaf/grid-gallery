# Grid Gallery

Just a simple Instagram like app that I built just because to demonstate some of the new features in React & Javascript

### Highlights

- Written in **TypeScript** which adds static typing and documentation
- Uses latest ECMAScript syntax & features such as **async/await**
- Using **React Hooks** and **Context** which are the newest cool features of React
- Not a single Class component used in this project! (due to above)
- Uses **React Router DOM** for routing with custom redirects for handling auth state
- Authentication with **Firebase**
- Custom hooks for getting Auth state & user data from Firebase/Firestore
- Uses **React Bootstrap** for proper implementation of Modal
