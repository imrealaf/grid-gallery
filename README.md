# Grid Gallery

Just a simple Instagram like app that I built just because to demonstate some of the new features in React & Javascript

### Highlights

- Written in **TypeScript** which adds static typing and documentation
- Uses latest ECMAScript syntax & features such as **async/await**
- Using **React Hooks** and **Context** which are some cool new features of React
- **Not a single Class component** used in this project! (due to above)
- Uses **React Router DOM** for routing with custom redirects for handling auth state
- **Authentication** with **Firebase** & therefore no back-end needed
- Fully intuitive **form validation** for login
- **Custom hooks** for simplifying getting Auth state & User data from Firebase/Firestore
- Uses **React Bootstrap** for proper React implementation of Bootstrap's Modal
