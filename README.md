# Grid Gallery

Just a simple Instagram like app that I built just because to demonstate some key concepts in modern React Apps.

### Highlights

- Written in **TypeScript** which adds static typing and documentation
- Uses latest ECMAScript syntax & features such as **async/await**
- Using **React Hooks** and **Context** which are the newest cool features of React
- Not a single Class component used in this project! (due to above)
- Uses **React Router DOM** for routing with custom redirects for handling auth state
- Authentication with **Firebase**
- Custom hooks for getting Auth state & user data from Firebase/Firestore
- Uses **React Bootstrap** for proper implementation of Modal

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
